# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Project Management Overview

OctoAcme follows an iterative, customer-centric project management lifecycle structured into six key phases:

1. **Initiation**: Projects begin with a lightweight 'Project One-pager' to validate business needs and success metrics.
2. **Planning**: Teams define scope, timelines, and resource allocation. Clear decision gates ensure stakeholder agreement before moving to execution.
3. **Execution**: Governed by a consistent team rhythm with daily or twice-weekly standups and weekly delivery syncs. Work is tracked through GitHub Projects with a standardized pipeline from backlog to completion.
4. **Risk Management**: Proactive risk identification and mitigation through a dedicated Risk Register and tiered escalation path (Team -> PM -> Product Lead -> Sponsor).
5. **Release**: Standardized checklists for major, minor, and patch releases, incorporating staging smoke tests and post-deployment verification to minimize production risks.
6. **Retrospective**: Mandatory retrospectives where teams convert learnings into actionable backlog items, fostering continuous improvement.

Success is driven by clear ownership and collaboration between multiple roles including Product Managers, Project Managers, Developers, UX Designers, Tech Leads, Release Managers, Customer Success Managers, and Data Analysts. Quality is integrated throughout the workflow through a 'shift-left' approach, requiring automated testing, security scanning, and code reviews before any code is merged.
